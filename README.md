# nerves

An agent that receives input from external sources, processes it, and communicates this information with Bitcoin miners. Work in progress. 

## Summary

Currently, the main intention is to use this software as a bridge between a [Victron](https://www.victronenergy.com/) solar panel system (via the [VRM API](https://docs.victronenergy.com/vrmapi/overview.html)) and Bitcoin miners running [Braiins OS](https://braiins.com/os/open-source). Given the fluctuating nature of solar energy, over the day and also over the year, it is necessary to monitor energy availability, and provide instructions to the miners based on that information.
